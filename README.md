# poly-grains
polyphonic granular synthesizer for norns-mother / organelle
Download the zip folder and place it in your \\norns\we\sidekick\patches\Organelle folder
Refresh the menu so it shows the "install zip file" option and select it.
Hopefully you may now select the patch from sidekick.
Copy the touchosc template polygrains.touchosc to your ipad.
You'll need to set the address in the patch it is located in the upper left corner - click pd touchOSC and set the ip address of your ipad

The four encoders on Fates are enc1: position enc2: grain length enc3: grain tempo enc4: rand pos

Midi keyboards may be used.  I have it set up for Native Instruments Komplete, but Norns Mother has its own midi-CC map that conflicts a bit with my map - a work in progress?
